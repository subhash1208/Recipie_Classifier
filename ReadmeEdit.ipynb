    "   # Face Attendance System\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "The Face Attendance System is a facial recognition-based attendance logging application. Utilizing a webcam, it identifies individuals in real-time and records their attendance, capturing both check-in and check-out times. This system leverages OpenCV for image processing, the face_recognition library for facial recognition, and numpy for numerical operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Features\n",
    "- **Real-Time Face Detection and Recognition:** Detects and recognizes faces using the `face_recognition` library.\n",
    "- **Attendance Logging:** Automatically logs attendance in a CSV file with the current date, including check-in and check-out times.\n",
    "- **Anti-Spoofing Mechanism:** Uses a pre-trained model to prevent spoofing attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "Ensure you have the following installed:\n",
    "- Python 3.x\n",
    "- OpenCV\n",
    "- face_recognition\n",
    "- numpy\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps\n",
    "1. **Clone the repository:**\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   git clone https://github.com/subhash1208/Face_Attendance.git\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "2. **Navigate to the project directory:**\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   cd Face_Attendance\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "3. **Install the required packages:**\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "## Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Prepare the Images**\n",
    "\n",
    "   Place images of known individuals in the `images` directory. The filename should be the name of the person.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Run the Main Script**\n",
    "\n",
    "   Execute the main script to start the attendance system:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   python attendance.py\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "3. **Attendance Logging**\n",
    "\n",
    "   The system will log check-in and check-out times in a CSV file named with the current date in the attendanceSheet directory.\n",
    "## Code Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Image Loading and Encoding**\n",
    "\n",
    "    The code loads images from the `images` directory, converts them to RGB format, and encodes them using the `face_recognition.face_encodings` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Real-Time Face Recognition**\n",
    "\n",
    "    The code captures webcam feed using OpenCV. Each frame is processed to detect and encode faces, which are then compared against the known encodings.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Attendance Posting**\n",
    "\n",
    "    The code logs attendance by writing the individual's name and current time to a CSV file. If the individual is already logged in, it updates the check-out time.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Anti-Spoofing**\n",
    "\n",
    "    The code calls an external anti-spoofing test function from the `Silent.test` module to verify if the detected face is real or a spoof.\n",
    "## Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Configuration**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensure the Silent-Face-Anti-Spoofing model is properly configured and the path to the model is correctly set in the script.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Environmental Requirements**\n",
    "\n",
    "A clear and well-lit environment is required for accurate facial recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Contribution\n",
    "\n",
    "**Get Involved!**\n",
    "\n",
    "Contributions are welcome! Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests for any improvements or bug fixes."
